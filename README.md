# Athena-AI-Tutor-Concept-Website
This was the first hackathon either of us have participated in; we hope you enjoy our landing page for "Athena", an AI tutor concept :)

Alex Goulden and Nettra Leandre

## Inspiration
The controversial topic of students using AI in academia; Our project aims to be a solution for this relatively recent issue.

## What it does
The AI in our project is only a concept, so we designed a landing page to discuss the possible implementations of an AI Tutor in ways that are beneficial to both students and teachers.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code to develop our website. After deciding who would work on what, we installed the "Live Share" extension by Microsoft to collaborate on coding at the same time; Nettra worked on the HTML and some of the CSS, while Alex was responsible for styling with CSS and a short JavaScript program (specifically for a scroll animation).

## Challenges we ran into
Relearning HTML and CSS; it's been a while since either of us have coded in those languages, but in the end we made the best of our knowledge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The website turned out a lot cleaner than expected; we're especially happy with all of the animations, since some of them weren't working right the first time around we implemented them.

## What we learned
We learned how to develop collaboratively in Visual Studio Code, and we learned some new ways to better style our page with animations thanks to CSS and some lines of JavaScript.

## What's next for Athena: AI Tutor
We can revisit Athena once we actually learn how to develop an AI Tutor and not just a concept as shown by this project.

## Built With
css, html, javascript, visual studio code
