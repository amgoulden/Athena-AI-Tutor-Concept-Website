            <h2>About Athena</h2>
                <br>
            <p>The <i>Athena</i> AI Tutor <b>concept</b> represents our entry for the Futuristic theme at the Chargerhacks 
                2023 hackathon and was created by College of the Canyons students <a href="https://github.com/PNettra" target="_blank">Nettra 
                Leandre</a> and <a href="https://github.com/amgoulden" target="_blank">Alex Goulden</a>. While brainstorming ideas for our 
                entry, we both acknowledged the growing popularity of AI chatbots, especially their controversial use in 
                academia by students.</p> 
                <br>
            <p>Therefore, we aimed to create an alternative by envisioning an AI tutor that could emulate the characteristics
                of a human tutor. This includes offering tailored lessons, supplementary learning materials, and more, without 
                merely providing a straightforward answer. Importantly, this concept stands to benefit teachers by augmenting 
                their capabilities, allowing for more individualized student attention and support, thereby enhancing the overall teaching and 
                learning experience.</p>
                <br>
            <p>To showcase our AI concept, we determined that creating a landing page would be the most effective approach. 
                This being our first hackathon, we wanted to keep it simple by utilizing HTML, CSS, and a touch of 
                JavaScript to develop the webpage.</p>
